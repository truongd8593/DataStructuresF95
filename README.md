# DataStructuresF95
Classical data structures written in F95 and strictly conformant to F95 standard. 

Data structures in this repo:

- Singly linked list (fully implemented). Some sorting algorithms will be implemented for linked list, including:
  + Selection sort (fully implemented).
  + Quick sort (partially implemented, ie. defect).
  + Merge sort (to be implemented).
  + Radix sort (to be implemented).
- Stack (to be implemented).
- Queue (to be implemented).
